# openssl-src does not have a build script for the target `aarch64-apple-ios-sim`, which we need.
# This fork has that target added and no functional changes. There is a pull request open for
# the fix but previous pull requests were closed with the same context as they were not security
# fixes. When this pull request is merged, we can depend on the `upstream` git repo or, when
# released, we can depend on the latest version of `openssl-src`.
